        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we're going to illustrate step 2. This involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT for short), also called instruction tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Supervised fine-tuning takes in a \"base model\" from step 1, i.e. a model that has been pre-trained on predicting the next token on internet text, and turns it into a \"chatbot\"/\"assistant\". This is done by fine-tuning the model on human instruction data, using the cross-entropy loss. This means that the model is still trained to predict the next token, although we now want the model to generate useful completions given an instruction like \"what are 10 things to do in London?\", \"How can I make pancakes?\" or \"Write me a poem about elephants\".\n",
        "\n",
        "To do this, one requires human annotators to collect useful completions, on which we can train the model. OpenAI for instance [hired human contractors for this](https://gizmodo.com/chatgpt-openai-ai-contractors-15-dollars-per-hour-1850415474), which were asked to generate useful completions given instructions, like \"In London, you can visit the Big Ben and (...)\". A nice collection of openly available SFT datasets can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/collections/HuggingFaceH4/awesome-sft-datasets-65788b571bf8e371c4e4241a).\n",
        "\n",
        "This way, the model becomes more useful: rather than simply predicting the next token (which might give undesirable outputs, like generating follow-up questions rather than answering the question), we now make it more likely that the model will output useful completions for any instruction we give it. We basically steer it in the direction of generating useful completions which a human could have written given any instruction."
